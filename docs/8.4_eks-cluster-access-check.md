# üß™ Amazon EKS - Cluster Access and Pod Identity

## ‚úÖ Objective
Verify that the current user has access to Amazon EKS clusters using `kubectl`.

---

## üîç Step 1: Display kubeconfig Settings

Run the following command to view the current kubeconfig context and confirm the cluster configuration:

```bash
kubectl config view
```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output (truncated for readability):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://<eks-endpoint>
    certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1...
  name: arn:aws:eks:<region>:<account-id>:cluster/<cluster-name>
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: arn:aws:eks:<region>:<account-id>:cluster/<cluster-name>
    user: arn:aws:eks:<region>:<account-id>:cluster/<cluster-name>
  name: arn:aws:eks:<region>:<account-id>:cluster/<cluster-name>
current-context: arn:aws:eks:<region>:<account-id>:cluster/<cluster-name>
```

## üîç Step 2: Get All Pods in All Namespaces

Use this command to confirm that you can access workloads within the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output:

```bash
NAMESPACE     NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   aws-node-xyz123                       1/1     Running   0          1d
kube-system   kube-proxy-abc456                     1/1     Running   0          1d
default       nginx-deployment-7dcb8dbbfc-12345     1/1     Running   0          4h
```

## üìå Confirmation Checklist

- [x] Were you able to view the kubeconfig settings successfully?
- [x] Were you able to list all pods in all namespaces?

If both commands executed successfully, then:
- Your `kubectl` is configured correctly.
- IAM permissions for the current user allow access to the EKS cluster.
