# üåê Accessing 2048 Game Application via Ingress

Once the Ingress resource is applied, an **internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB)** will be automatically created by AWS.

This allows external traffic to reach the application running in the Kubernetes cluster using the Load Balancer's DNS record.

---

## üîç Step 1: Get the Ingress Resource

Run the following command to view the Ingress resource and its associated ALB DNS address:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n game-2048
```

---

### ‚úÖ Expected Output

You should see an output similar to this:

```text
NAME              CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                                 PORTS   AGE
game-2048         <none>   *       k8s-game2048-ingress2-46dbc758ae-232597482.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com  80      5m
```

---

## üåê Step 2: Access the Application

Copy the value under the `ADDRESS` column (the Load Balancer DNS name), and paste it into your browser:

```
http://k8s-game2048-ingress2-46dbc758ae-232597482.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

You should now see the 2048 game running in your browser.

---

## üß≠ Step 3: Explore in AWS Console

To explore more details:

1. Go to the **AWS Console**
2. Navigate to **EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers**
3. Look for the Load Balancer with the matching DNS name
4. Inspect listener rules, target groups, and health checks

---

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ingress abstracts the internal pod/service IPs and exposes a unified public endpoint through the AWS ALB automatically.
