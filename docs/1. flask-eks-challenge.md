# üöÄ Challenge: Build & Deploy a Configurable Flask App on EKS

Welcome to your mini deployment challenge! This task will guide you through building a lightweight web app, containerizing it, deploying it to your EKS cluster, and modifying it using environment configurations.

---

## üéØ Objective

1. Create a Flask-based web application that displays a simple message:  
   `Hello World!!`  
   The message should be displayed in **blue** color.

2. Containerize this application using Docker.

3. Deploy the container as a pod in your existing EKS cluster using `kubectl`.

4. Modify the app so that the text color can be changed using an **environment variable** (e.g., `TEXT_COLOR`).

5. Redeploy the pod with a different color (e.g., red) by updating the environment variable.

---

## üß© Hints

### ‚úÖ Flask App Reference
Use the official Flask documentation to start:
- https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/

To read an environment variable in Python:
```python
import os
color = os.environ.get("TEXT_COLOR", "blue")
```

Use that color in your HTML response.

---

### ‚úÖ Containerization
Refer to:
- https://docs.docker.com/samples/python/

Ensure:
- Your `Dockerfile` exposes port 5000
- Flask runs on `host='0.0.0.0'` so it‚Äôs reachable from the pod

---

### ‚úÖ Kubernetes Deployment
- Write a `pod.yaml` file
- Inject the env variable using:

```yaml
env:
  - name: TEXT_COLOR
    value: red
```

- Use `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml` to deploy
- Use `kubectl port-forward` or a LoadBalancer service to access it

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- `app.py`
- `Dockerfile`
- `pod.yaml`
- (Optional) `requirements.txt`
- Screenshot of deployed web page with blue and red text

---

## üéÅ Bonus Points

- Create a LoadBalancer service
- Tag and push your Docker image to ECR
- Automate the deployment with a script

---

Have fun and good luck!
