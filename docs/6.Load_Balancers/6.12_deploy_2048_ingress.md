# 🎮 Deploying 2048 Game with Ingress Service

In this step, we'll deploy a sample 2048 game application using a predefined YAML configuration. The deployment will include:

- A **Namespace**
- A **Deployment**
- A **Service**
- An **Ingress Resource**

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 📁 Step 1: Navigate to the EKS Course Directory

Ensure you are in the correct directory:

```bash
cd /root/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-course/eks
```

---

### 🚀 Step 2: Apply the Deployment YAML

Use the following command to create all resources:

```bash
kubectl create -f 2048_full.yaml
```

This YAML file includes all the necessary components to demonstrate how ingress works with a Kubernetes deployment.

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Inspect the Resources

Verify that the following resources have been created:

- ✅ **Namespace**  
- ✅ **Deployment**  
- ✅ **Service**  
- ✅ **Ingress**

You can inspect the resources using:

```bash
kubectl get all -n <namespace>
kubectl get ingress -A
```

Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace defined in the YAML (e.g., `2048-game`).

---

## ✅ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Are the resources from `2048_full.yaml` created?
- [ ] Is the **Ingress** resource created and visible?

Once confirmed, you can proceed to access the application using the ingress hostname (if configured).
