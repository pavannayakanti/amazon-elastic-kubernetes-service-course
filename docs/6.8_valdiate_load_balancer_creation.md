## 🌐 Validate Load Balancer Creation via AWS Console

Follow these steps to check and access the Load Balancer created for the `webapp-color` service:

---

### 🔎 Step 1: Navigate to Load Balancers in AWS EC2 Console

- Go to the [**AWS EC2 Console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2)
- In the left navigation panel, scroll down to **Load Balancers** under **Load Balancing**
- Look for a newly created Load Balancer (usually prefixed with `a` or `k8s`)

---

### 📄 Step 2: Confirm Load Balancer Status

- ✅ **Check if the Load Balancer is in an `active` state**:
  - Status column should show `active` (green check mark)

- 🌍 **Check if the Load Balancer is internet-facing**:
  - Look at the **Scheme** column — it should say `internet-facing`

### 🌐 Step 3: Access the Application

- Copy the **DNS Name** of the Load Balancer (e.g., `a1b2c3d4.elb.amazonaws.com`)
- Paste it into your browser
