# 💽 4.2 Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides **durable, high-performance block storage** volumes for use with Amazon EC2 and Amazon EKS instances.

---

## 🧱 What is Amazon EBS?

- EBS offers **block-level storage**, meaning it behaves like a raw, unformatted disk that you can format and mount as needed.
- It is **zonal**, meaning an EBS volume is accessible only within the **same Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- You can attach EBS volumes to **EC2 instances** or **EKS worker nodes**.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- File systems and log storage
- Persistent Kubernetes workloads (via **Persistent Volumes**)
- Boot volumes for EC2 instances

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- You **create a volume** in a specific AZ.
- Attach the volume to a compute instance (EC2 or EKS Node).
- Mount it and begin storing data.
- Volumes can persist beyond the lifecycle of the instance and be **snapshotted** for backups or replication.

## 📊 Volume Types

| Volume Type | Use Case | Performance |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| gp3         | General purpose | Configurable IOPS |
| gp2         | General purpose | Baseline performance |
| io1/io2     | I/O intensive apps | High IOPS & durability |
| st1         | Throughput-optimized | Large volumes, log processing |
| sc1         | Cold HDD | Archival storage |

## 🔄 Integration with Amazon EKS

- Amazon EKS supports EBS using the **CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver**.
- You can:
  - **Statically provision** volumes (create manually in AWS and attach to Kubernetes).
  - **Dynamically provision** volumes using `StorageClass`.

---

## 🧩 Related Kubernetes Concepts

- **PersistentVolume (PV)** — maps to an EBS volume.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** — used by pods to request storage.
- **StorageClass** — defines how PVs are provisioned dynamically.

---

## 📈 Key Features

- **High Availability** within an AZ.
- **Snapshot support** for backup and disaster recovery.
- **Encryption at rest** using AWS KMS.
- Seamless **integration with EKS CSI driver** for Kubernetes-native storage.

> 💡 Tip: Always ensure your EKS nodes and EBS volumes are in the **same AZ** to avoid attachment errors!
