# Network Policy Allow Lab

## Step 1: Allow Ingress to nginx Pod from test-pod

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: test
EOF
```
## Step 2: Fetch the IP address of nginx pod
``` bash
kubectl get pod nginx -o wide
```
## Step 3: Verify That Communication is Allowed

```bash
kubectl exec -it test-pod -- ping <nginx-pod-ip>
```

> Make sure to replace `<nginx-pod-ip>` with the actual IP address of the nginx pod.

### Expected Outcome:
``` bash
~ $ kubectl exec -it test-pod -- ping 172.31.36.223
