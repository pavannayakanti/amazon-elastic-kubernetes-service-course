# Verify User Access Again

## Step: Verify Access Rights of the IAM User

Run the following command to check if the IAM user `iamuser-eksuser` can access pods in the default namespace:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i get pod --as iamuser-eksuser
```

### Expected Result:
```bash
yes
```

This indicates that the user now has the appropriate role and role binding permissions to access pods in the default namespace.

### Validation Questions:
- Is the `iamuser-eksuser` able to get pod in the default namespace?
